# OpenWR

OpenWR (OpenWear) is an open hardware standard for wearable IoT devices.  

## Hardware

Hardware developed will have open specs that can be built by anyone, under a permissive license.  The associated software will be delivered along with the hardware design.  Where possible, it should be possible to click to build a PCB or find a reference to places to buy hardware builds and components.

## Projects

Projects are divided into prototypes, products, and archives (of old/unsupported projects).

Prototypes are intended to experiment on small demonstrations of functionality, or as iterations on a design before promoting a concept into a product.

A product is a fully supported design with active software development, and some expectation of hardware components being available, and at least one public source to purchase the components or a completed product.

The archives are where products move to that are no longer supported.  This may happen because of lack of available components.  Or it may be due to a change in focus area by the team.
