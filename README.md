# OpenWR

OpenWR (OpenWear) is an open hardware standard for wearable IoT devices.  

## Principles of Design

We are promoting groundbreaking ideas:
- Own your own tech stack (lately companies act like they own everything and only grant you a right to use things and feel free to take away features)
- Invest in your platforms, but invest in a forever purchase (when you buy stuff, buy stuff that will last you for your lifetime if possible. Try not to buy things that will be recycled waste in a few years. Is the company providing you will the ability to keep your gear running over time, or will they suddenly cut off support?)
- Own your data and control your privacy(where is your data going? Is the company requiring you to install their app, set up an account, and tracking you? Are they giving you control over who gets to use your data and for what? Do you own your data?)
- Deplatform (Where possible, get off platforms. Find small ways not to live in a FANG universe).

## Hardware

Hardware developed will have open specs that can be built by anyone, under a permissive license.  The associated software will be delivered along with the hardware design.  Where possible, it should be possible to click to build a PCB or find a reference to places to buy hardware builds and components.

## Projects

Projects are divided into prototypes, products, and archives (of old/unsupported projects).

Prototypes are intended to experiment on small demonstrations of functionality, or as iterations on a design before promoting a concept into a product.

A product is a fully supported design with active software development, and some expectation of hardware components being available, and at least one public source to purchase the components or a completed product.

The archives are where products move to that are no longer supported.  This may happen because of lack of available components.  Or it may be due to a change in focus area by the team.

- Donate: $ETH/$POLY: 0x00000001.zil , or $SOL: truedat101.sol ... proceeds make it possible to just do open source!

## Inspirations and Attributions

- One of the truly inspiring projects in recent weeks/months is Meshtastic.  Hurray for open source.  Many have tried proprietary networks, non-open solutions, etc., and Meshtastic found a great use case for LoRa.
- Ethernet: I had a chance to meet Bob M. and he told me his story of the first ethernet test.  It took place in my office at PARC.  He had my office years before I arrived there.  The ethernet story is worth learning about.  It's why Novell didn't win and Ethernet did win.  Business people might say PARC didn't succeed with Ethernet, but they did spawn what became CISCO and literally every other connected device out there.
- Apple: Before they were the dog, they were the underdog.  Their stuff had principles but they weren't the best for price or performance.  You could love certain things about the imperfection of a Mac.  Nowadays, they are more like an elite athlete, high performance, high price.  Still, I look backwards at where they came from.
